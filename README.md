## 📝 Project Overview  
This project visualizes weather data from various  cities using **Power BI**. The goal is to effectively communicate key insights about temperature, humidity, rainfall, and more — using interactive and aesthetically designed visualizations.

---
## 📁 Files Included
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `second.pbix` | Power BI report file with interactive visualizations |
| `Weather5_with_city.csv` | Weather dataset containing temperature, humidity, dew point, etc. across cities |

---

## 📊 Visualization Objectives

1. **Identify seasonal trends** in temperature and rainfall.
2. **Compare weather patterns** across different cities.
3. **Analyze correlation** between variables (e.g., humidity vs. dew point).
4. **Enable user-driven exploration** through filters and drill-throughs.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Power BI** (Primary visualization tool)
- Dataset: `Weather5_with_city.csv`
---
## 📈 Key Visualizations
| Chart Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Line Chart** | Show temperature trends over time across cities |
| **Area Chart** | Illustrate precipitation intensity and city-wise distribution |
| **Scatter Plot** | Reveal correlation between humidity and dew point |
| **Pie Chart** | Represent city-wise rainfall share |
| **Map Chart** | Visualize geospatial weather data with bubble sizes |
| **Slicers** | Filter by weather type, city, or month |
| **Drill-through** | Zoom into city-specific data from summary views |

## 🧩 Interactivity Features
- ✅ Slicers for City and Weather Type  
- ✅ Drill-through pages  
- ✅ Tooltip interactions  
- ✅ Back button navigation  
- ✅ Filter visuals on multiple pages  

---

## 📖 Storytelling Highlights
Each page includes text boxes summarizing key insights, such as:

- “Temperatures increase steadily from January to June across most cities.”
- “Cities like Los Angeles and New York show different rainfall patterns—New York has higher summer rainfall.”
- “As relative humidity increases, dew point also rises, showing a positive correlation.”

---

## ✅ Accuracy & Validation
- All data values have been cross-checked for consistency.
- Proper units, legends, axis labels, and formatting used for clarity.
